          <h2>Hello there! My name is <span className="font-bold text-3xl lg:text-4xl text-amber-300">Damian</span>, and here's a short introduction about myself ðŸ˜‰</h2>
          <br/>
          <p>I'm currently a Year 3 undergraduate at Singapore's <span className="font-bold text-amber-200">Nanyang Technological University [NTU]</span>, pursuing a <span className="font-bold text-amber-200">Bachelor of Science [BSc] with the School of Biological Sciences [SBS]</span> as part of the four-year Double Major Programme (Honours) in <Link href={"https://www.ntu.edu.sg/sbs/admissions/programmes/undergraduate/undergraduate-programmes/detail/bachelor-of-science-in-biomedical-sciences-and-biobusiness"} className="font-bold text-amber-200 underline hover:text-amber-400">Biomedical Sciences and BioBusiness [BSB]</Link>. Under this programme, I will be cross-trained in biomedical sciences/biotechnology and biobusiness (business/management with relevance to the biomedical/healthcare sector).</p>
          <br/>
          <p>I'm a budding scientist eager to learn across a vast multitude of fields with a primary focus on <span className="font-bold text-amber-200">Bioinformatics / Computational Biology</span>, a fascinating intersection of the amazing, ever-intertwining domains of the biological and computational sciences.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>I have adopted an intensive growth mindset with the goal of building a set of <Link href={"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/management/t-shaped-skills/"} className="font-bold text-amber-200 underline hover:text-amber-400">T-shaped skills</Link> to truly provide value to society. I have set my in-depth learning focuses on <span className="font-bold text-amber-200">Biomedical Sciences, BioBusiness and Bioinformatics</span> while simultaneously broadening my scope of knowledge to encompass <span className="font-bold text-amber-200"> Business, Finance and Economics</span> alongside my personal hobbyist indulgences in <span className="font-bold text-amber-200">History, Politics and Global Affairs</span>.</p>
          <br/>
          {/* <p>Additionally, despite my less-than-satisfactory aptitude towards the languages, I enjoy learning how to <span className="font-bold text-2xl text-amber-200">converse in foreign languages</span> from my incredibly supportive international friends because of its enriching importance in every society's culture, tradition and history.</p> */}
          <p>On the side, I really love reading and writing, recreational kayaking, keeping fit, cooking and baking, and more recently, I've been doing web development as a more mentally-invigorating hobby.</p>
