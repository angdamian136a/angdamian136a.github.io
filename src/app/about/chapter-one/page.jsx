                In 2010, I vividly remember a distressing scene at home as my parents had just returned home from the hospital after what seemed to be a routine check-up. I could hear muffled sobbing from their room and sensed a dreadfully serious atmosphere setting about me. Yet, I was too naive to truly understand what was going on, even when my parents gathered everyone to share the grim news that my mother’s check-up had revealed a Stage 4 breast cancer. Unbeknownst to me, the first cracks in my little utopia had begun to form.

                Despite having to undergo painful chemotherapy treatment on a regular basis, Mom never faltered and she continued to care for us albeit with minor tweaks in her routine, her diet and her emotional state. Things got better as I believed they would, the treatment was effective. Before long, her cancer had been “cured” and that was the end of it, naught but a frightening scare, or so we thought…

                A year after the successful battle with cancer, a most hideous term entered my vocabulary – “relapse”. From my recent exposure to cancer theory in university, I now understand that the cancer must have already metastasised from the breast to other parts of the body. It was a demoralising reality, and incredibly terrifying for once the cancer has invaded the rest of the body, it has advanced into a state of high-resistance and high-proliferation near impossible to dislodge. But what could a 12-year-old-me actually comprehend? Should I have known better than to have just assumed that if a battle had been won before, it could be won again. Perhaps this time, it might even be easier, like a tested immune system being able to better fend off an invading pathogen… right?

                Mom was a fervent believer of our faith, a little-known religion called Sukyo Mahikari born from the ruins of post-World War 2 (WW2) Japan. Her initial victory over her breast cancer became a shining example of her commitment to our religion. With the relapse of cancer, Mom became a more intense believer. She would visit the Dojo (place of worship) and other members’ homes to offer her prayers and receive (and give) “True Light”, a customary practice of our religion. Visiting the Dojo with her on a regular basis, I was enamoured by the admiration and respect that she drew from our fellow members and, for a time, I truly believed in the divine powers of this religion.

                By 2012, the situation was looking bleak. The cancer was not going away, it was spreading even more aggressively and the doctors recommended stronger treatments for her. This did little to slow down the spread, merely weakening Mom’s physical strength, immune system and other bodily functions including taste (her use of ginger and vinegar to enrich the taste of every meal has since created a nauseating reaction in me towards the very smell of those condiments). Soon, Mom was spending the better part of her day asleep in bed, waking up terribly nauseous and heavily depressed by her current state – it was a gruelling year or so with no sign of recovery.

                With my father away working 6 days a week, it was down to the children to take over the housework and give “Light” to Mom almost daily. By then, I was in Primary 6 taking the PSLE (Primary School Leaving Examination) but had to support the chores more because my older brother was studying for his GCE (General Certificate of Education) A-Level examinations while my older sister had little interest in doing manual labour. I did most of everything that I was told, regardless of my bitterness towards my siblings for having to bear the brunt of the menial tasks. I loved my Mom, for me, she was still my source of comfort with emotional matters, and having grown up to be a rather sensitive child, she was the only one in whom I could genuinely confide my issues (Dad was a quiet, upright man – he spoke little but set an example through his actions and there is no question about how much he has sacrificed and laboured for our family).

                Throughout the latter half of 2013, Mom was frequenting the hospital and even began overnight stays at the hospital ward. I did not understand the seriousness of her condition, I was too young to be filled in on the details. I was confused, frustrated and sad. But I buried these emotions under the fleeting bouts of happiness extracted from watching movies, YouTube videos and playing online games when my parents were out of the house – I began to enjoy the freedom from chores and religious practices whenever my Mom was warded at the hospital.

                In December 2013, Mom was warded in the hospital again and kept on a dialysis machine, her kidneys had failed. “Another round of hospitalisation…”, I thought to myself, the gravity of the situation had escaped my perception. On the 17th of December, I visited Mom alone, attempting to pass the time by reading a Chinese book that I did not understand (my Chinese was atrocious). Mom was angry at me about something, I cannot recall what it was she was upset about, but our interaction that day left me feeling bitter towards her. I could not wait to return home to be free of her nagging. I declined to visit her the next day, resentful over a petty argument. I should have known better… I should have done more…I should have.

                On 19th December, Mom awoke in a paralysed state. An infection and fever had set in, exploiting her near dysfunctional immune system, the liver had failed. She could not move or speak but she seemed able to hear and see at least. My maternal grandparents flew down from Seremban to witness their beloved daughter in such a dreadful state. I was in shock, Jie was possibly feeling the same way, Dad and Kor were stoic, putting up a brave front for us. Each of us had some time to say a few words to Mom, I cannot even remember what I said, I was still stubbornly believing that this was a passing event and she would soon regain consciousness and return home. As it was approaching midnight, my other relatives brought us home, except Dad and Kor who stayed overnight with Mom. “Hopefully tomorrow she will be better…”, I remember being told.

                It was close to 1am on the 20th of December, we were getting ready to go to bed when Dad called us to inform us that our relatives were on the way to pick us up to go to the hospital. He did not say anything else. I did as I was told, but wondered why we were visiting at this hour. I was not ready to entertain anything more shocking than the sight of Mom lying partially comatose in an ICU ward. When we reached the ward, the news finally broke that Mom had passed away not long after midnight. Jie was tearfully distraught, begging Mom to wake up. I was in utter disbelief, processing her death. In that moment, staring at Mom’s lifeless body still hooked up to the machines and monitors and tubes, without shedding a tear, I hardened my heart and seeded a conviction in my mind that no mother deserved such a terrible son as me.

                <br/>
                <p>
                Thus began the long struggle of my morality. Not only did I question my worthiness as a son, I lost my ability to feel deeply for others, their happiness made me spiteful, their grievances made me indifferent, their pity made me remorseful (for I was not deserving of sympathy). It was much better to be alone, for loneliness was what I deserved. I longed for pain and suffering to punish myself for my sins. I desired a life in service to others, volunteering to help the needy to selfishly atone for my disgusting crimes. Yet, this flood of emotions was kept locked away in the vaults of my thoughts. I learnt to put up a smile for others, to live in the moment detached from reality, to suppress my memories in order to be able to focus on the task at hand.

                Mom was gone. I had no more emotional net to fall back on. I no longer had a mother to say goodbye to before leaving for school, to greet when I came home, to talk to when times were hard, to discipline me when I did something wrong, to teach me the ways of the world with the tough love of a mother. Circumstances forced me to either find someone new to be emotionally dependent on or to claw my way to independence and self-reliance. Faced with a similar choice, my whole family opted for the former; defiantly I adopted the latter option. I wanted to be different, I believed I was different, I am different from my family. I promised myself and to Mom that I would pursue success incessantly, that I would not falter in my ambitions, that I would strive to provide value to society, that I would be a better person, I owed her that much to make her proud. Else, for what use was my existence…
